## Overview
### Description
Tracks the amount of personal carbon foot print reduction a user can achieve by choosing greener transportation.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Environment friendly 
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users distance traveled using enviornmentaly friendly options to calculate reduction in harm to the plant, and connects them to green transportation options.
- **Market:** Anybody who needs to go places! 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wishes.
- **Scope:** First we would find target routes that are green to achieve the end placement, and then calculate the reduction in carbon footprint.
